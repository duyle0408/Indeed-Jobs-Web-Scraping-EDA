        "- As a recent graduate from the Master's of Science in Business Analytics program, I am currently on the job hunt for an entry-level position as a Data Analyst.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **2. Task**\n",
        "- By taking on an end-to-end project, I aim to collect data from the Indeed web page, perform exploratory data analysis and text analytics to uncover the keywords provided in the job description, in order to see which jobs are the right fit for me.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **3. Action**\n",
        "### **3.1 Data Collection**\n",
        "Using Python libraries such as Requests, Selenium & BeautifulSoup, I gathered information on Entry Level Data Analyst jobs on [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/). This includes:\n",
        "- Making a request call to the Indeed server\n",
        "- Using Selenium as a web driver\n",
        "- BeautifulSoup as an HTML parser\n",
        "- Saving result files in CSV format\n",
        "\n",
        "### **3.2 Data Cleaning and Standardization**\n",
        "- Utilizing Python's Data Analysis libraries such as Pandas and Numpy to clean and standardize the raw data\n",
        "- Removing missing/duplicate values as needed\n",
        "- Re-formatting column data types\n",
        "- Manual (sanity) checks for data integrity such as state locations, salary range, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **3.3 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**\n",
        "Performing EDA and visualizing metrics with Plotly Express for interactive graphs and better readability:\n",
        "- Determining the number of entry-level jobs per state\n",
        "- Analyzing the overall rating of all companies in the dataset and each state's average rating\n",
        "- Exploring the salary range for certain analytic skills (Python, SQL, Excel, Data Viz)\n",
        "- Identifying the most in-demand skills (soft skills included) for a data analyst\n",
        "- Finding the highest salaries for entry-level data analyst positions (outliers for salary)\n",

        "\n",
