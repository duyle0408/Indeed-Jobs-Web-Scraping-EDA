AbsoluteCARE Medical and Pharmacy,Medical Economics Data Analyst,"Columbia, MD 21044",2.8 out of 5,,,"Why Work at AbsoluteCare? At AbsoluteCare, we serve the most vulnerable individuals in America. These are our neighbors, people who are at higher risk for disease or who have multiple, complex, chronic illnesses. Often, they deal with an unequal healthcare system and wind up seeking basic care from emergency rooms. We take these patients out of those spaces and turn them into members: people who are entitled to some of the best, most focused care this country has to offer. We call this “care beyond medicine.” We have turned the doctor’s office into a comprehensive care center. Here, we surround our members with a core care team of doctors, nurses, social workers, and medical assistants who have the time and skills to get to know our members’ needs. We make the most important services available to our members under one roof. This includes a pharmacy, X-rays, a blood lab, nutrition services, urgent care, and much more. We don’t stop at our four walls. We engage members in the communities where we all live to find the people who need us most. Through these community care teams, we remove the barriers to healthcare that so many people face daily. And it works. Our unique care is guided by our core values of accountability, caring, trust, and teamwork. We call it ACT2. Job Summary: The Data Analyst will inform decision making and develop actionable insights to deliver optimal patient care and outcomes to support AbsoluteCare’s clinical, financial, and operational goals. The Medical Economics Data Analyst will work in close collaboration with Clinical, Pharmacy, and executive leadership to design, develop reports and conduct analyses using health care utilization, operational, clinical, and financial data from various health care information sources to measure and drive member and care model outcomes. The Data Analyst will review, interpret, and analyze clinical and operational data from the Electronic Health Record (eClinicalWorks), pharmacy point of sale system, population health management systems, and health plan payer data and deliver reports that respond to critical business needs.
