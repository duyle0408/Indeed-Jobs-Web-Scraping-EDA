# Indeed Job Scraping, EDA & NLP Analysis

## Executive Summary

### 1. Situation
As a recent graduate from the Master's of Science in Business Analytics program, I am currently on the job hunt for an entry-level position as a Data Analyst.

### 2. Task
By taking on an end-to-end project, I aim to collect data from the Indeed web page, perform exploratory data analysis and text analytics to uncover the keywords provided in the job description, in order to see which jobs are the right fit for me.

### 3. Action

#### 3.1: Data Collection
Using Python libraries such as Requests, Selenium, and BeautifulSoup, I gathered information on Entry Level Data Analyst jobs on [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/). This includes:
- Making a request call to the Indeed server.
- Using Selenium as a web driver.
- Parsing HTML with BeautifulSoup.
- Saving results in CSV format.

#### 3.2: Data Cleaning
After saving the files as CSV, I:
- Utilized Python's data analysis libraries such as Pandas and Numpy to clean and standardize the raw data.
- Removed missing/duplicate values as needed.
- Reformatted column data types.
- Performed manual checks for data integrity, such as state locations, salary range, etc.

#### 3.3: Exploratory Data Analysis
Performed EDA, visualized metrics with Plotly Express, and answered questions such as:
- How many entry-level jobs are there per state?
- What is the overall rating of all companies in the dataset? What is each state's average rating?
- What is the salary range for certain analytic skills (Python, SQL, Excel, Data Viz)?
- What are the most in-demand skills (including soft skills) for a data analyst?
- What are the highest salaries for entry-level data analyst positions?
- What is the relationship between company rating and salary?

#### 3.4: Text Analytics
Performed text analytics, including:
- Tokenization.
- Lemmatization.
- Text preprocessing, such as stop-words removal.
- WordCloud visualization.
- Unsupervised learning using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model to extract common words into topics to uncover key responsibilities of an entry-level data analyst.

### 4. Result
As a result of this comprehensive analysis, I identified the key skills and qualifications most sought after for entry-level data analyst positions, including SQL, Excel, and Python. This knowledge can help streamline the recruitment process by focusing on candidates with these core competencies.

### 5. Actionable Outcomes
